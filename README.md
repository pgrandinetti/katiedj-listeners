This repository contains the source code for the software listeners that can be used to retrieve data for free from the brodcast at [http://katiedj.com](http://katiedj.com). The code in this repository is released under the MIT license. You should have received a copy of the license along with the code; if not, then please visit the official license page [https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).


## Background

Katie DJ is the first free traffic data broadcast. In other words, is a web platform that streams data related to road network traffic (e.g., number of vehicles in the streets). Such data are open and accessible to everyone.

  - No registration is required.
  - No email is asked.
  - No information at all is asked: data is simply broadcast to the world and anyone can "listen to" (read, download) it.


## What, Why, How?

Please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions at [http://www.katiedj.com/#faq](http://katiedj.com/#faq). Furthermore, if some question of yours is not answered there then we encourage to get in touch with us. The easiest way to do so is to open a ticket/issue in [Katie Dj repository](https://github.com/pgrandinetti/katiedj/issues).

## Download the data

We release open-source clients that handle connection and data download from Katie DJ. You are not forced to use our clients (you can write your own), but using ours should save you time. We plan on releasing clients for the most common "scientific" programming languages. At the time of this writing, only the Python3 client has been released.
